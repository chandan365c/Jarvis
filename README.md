# Chatbot with LLM APIs
This project is a chatbot that utilizes Large Language Model (LLM) APIs to interact with users. It allows users to send messages and receive intelligent responses based on the capabilities of the language model. The chatbot can handle various tasks, such as answering questions, providing recommendations, etc.

## Features
- **Interactive Chat:** Users can type and send messages, and the chatbot responds accordingly.
- **User Authentication:** Users can sign in and register to start a chat session.
- **Recent Chats:** Users can see a list of their previous interactions and continue chatting based on past prompts.
- **Profile Management:** Users can update their profile information.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Routing:** React Router for page navigation
- **State Management:** React's useState and useContext for managing app state
- **API:** Google Gemini
- **Backend:** MongoDB
- **CSS:** Styled components and external CSS for UI components

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
